.. py:function:: generate_files(yaml_filename: str, output_folder: str, rbp_path: str, train: bool = True)

   Main file responsible for generating the files that will be sent to
   HOVOR (`contingent-plan-executor`) for executor.

   Args:
   - yaml_filename (str): The path to the filled out YAML configuration.
   - output_folder (str): Output folder where the files will be stored.
   - rbp_path (str): Path to the `rbp` directory so the planner can be run.
   - train (bool, optional): Determines if training is required. It is best to
   set to False if you made changes to the YAML that require some new output
   files, but the NLU model is not affected (no changes in the Rasa NLU YAML
   configuration). Defaults to True.

   Raises:
   - (Exception): Raised if the planner was not able to find a
   valid plan. Happens if the YAML configuration (and by proxy, the PDDL) is
   invalid in some way (i.e. missing actions, can't get out of a loop, etc.)

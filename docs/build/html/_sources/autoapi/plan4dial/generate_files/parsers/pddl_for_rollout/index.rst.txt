===========================================================

.. py:module:: plan4dial.generate_files.parsers.pddl_for_rollout

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   This module contains all the functions necessary to store the PDDL fluent
   configuration in an easy-to-access way so that given an action, we can easily
   retrieve what fluents are in its preconditions and which fluents are in each
   of its outcomes. This is only used for the rollout implementation for beam
   search, as it needs to be able to traverse the conversation based on ALL
   applicable actions and not just the solution generated by the PRP planner.

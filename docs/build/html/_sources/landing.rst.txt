Framework Flow
---------------
.. image:: figs/flow.png

Here we detail the design flow of our approach, with links at each step:

The developer writes a `YAML file <https://github.com/QuMuLab/plan4dial/tree/main/plan4dial/local_data/gold_standard_bot/gold_standard_bot.yml>`_ which contains a declarative description of their agent. 
The file is then passed to Plan4Dial, which converts the file to raw PDDL and attempts to generate a plan. 
Note that Plan4Dial prevents the need to write raw PDDL, which becomes complex for many action types. 
The valid plan, if found, is then passed to our extension of Hovor to execute the conversation, either through the CLI or in our embeddable web UI.

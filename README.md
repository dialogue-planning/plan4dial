Generates a chatbot given a simple YAML configuration using automated planning for conversation navigation and machine learning for NLU.

## Documentation
https://qumulab.github.io/plan4dial/

## Requirements
**Note: Currently, Plan4Dial only supports Linux/WSL due to the restrictions on the RBP planner.**  
For ease of use and reducing the chance of import or versioning errors, it is recommended that you use a virtual environment such as `venv`.  
Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary libraries before using.  
Run `python -m spacy download en_core_web_md` to download the appropriate Spacy model. Along with Rasa, this is used for NLU.

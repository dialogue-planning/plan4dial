"""This module contains all the functions necessary to store the PDDL fluent
configuration in an easy-to-access way so that given an action, we can easily retrieve
what fluents are in its preconditions and which fluents are in each of its outcomes.
This is only used for the rollout implementation for beam search, as it needs to be
able to traverse the conversation based on ALL applicable actions and not just the
solution generated by the PRP planner.
